## **Overview and Origin** 
---
Founded in 2003 by Raymon Deux, [***NinjaTrader***](https://www.investopedia.com/ninjatrader-review-4706930) is an online trading software and market data service company that focuses on providing high-performance trading software  for active traders looking to trade stocks, options, futures and Forex products. With a funded account, the ***NinjaTrader*** platform is free to use for charting, market analysis, and live trading (the SIM version is free even without a funded account).

 The idea of the company came back to 2003 when Raymon Deux  found himself expecting more from his trading platform and, after a futile search for alternatives, he decided to build his own. By today this Company has not been funded.

## **Pros & Cons**

---

### **Pros**

* Futures trading on ***NinjaTrader*** is incredibly seamless, thanks to a plethora of tools and services available to support your trade. The company provides unlimited simulated futures trading, extensive historical data, unfiltered professional futures market data and a free 24-hour emergency trade desk. There are also 100+ indicators included on its platform as well as access to hundreds of third-party trading applications.
***NinjaTrader*** offers auto-trade algorithmic trading strategies across multiple future markets to eliminate emotional trading and save you time. Its advanced trade management feature gives you access to predefined trade exits and entries for great consistency with your trades. Traders enjoy free access to vast market analysis, advanced charting and trade simulation with ***NinjaTrader***. It has the ability to place simulated trades, complete with an imaginary account and profit/loss summary. Sim trading can be especially helpful to newer traders who haven't had much practice placing trades—and dealing with the inevitable mistakes that happen, such as costly order entry mistakes (e.g., hitting BUY instead of SELL, trading more contracts than intended).
 

* The ***NinjaTrader*** platform is ideal for active traders who want lots of technical analysis tools. The platform boasts excellent charting, real-time analysis, customizable technical indicators, Chart Trader (a chart-based order entry tool), and thousands of apps and add-ons from 3rd-party developers.


* “Quants,” are the brains behind complex trading programs. Specialists in this area guide securities firms, investment banks and hedge funds in making informed decisions about markets, pricing and financial risk.

* The platform supports all the usual order types, including market, limit, stop market, and stop-limit orders as well as advanced OCO (one cancels other) orders.

* ***NinjaTrader***'s ATM Strategies provide discretionary traders with semi-automated features to manage their positions. Alternatively, you can fully automate a strategy using a "point and click" construction for non-programmers, or by using ***NinjaTrader***'s C#-based trading framework.

### **Cons**

* If you are a stock and/or options trader/investor, you will need an account of your own with a compatible broker such as interactive brokers or TD Ameritrade.  Note that the selection of affiliated brokers may be different from country to country.
* Technical analysts will get all the charts, tools, screeners, scanners, filters and indicators they can imagine but investors looking for more extensive fundamental data research may have to look somewhere else.
* ***NinjaTrader***, being a program you download and use locally, can create some challenges with execution speed of scans.  Particularly when involving hundreds of symbols.  On the same token, using the software to trade live through a third-party broker like Interactive Brokers is basically adding steps in the execution of the trades.  I found that many traders do execute their trades with their regular broker but use the ***NinjaTrader*** software for planning and testing strategies.
